Project name:- IoT based Smart Library Automation System.

Instructor:-  Mike Aleshams.

Description:-
Introducing a RFID technology based system developing self-service with IoT to improve the eficiency in the library. Used a RFID tags to identify the books and users to process the information and send a real time data through a cloud server [Thingspeak]. To increase a security in a library by using a Camera module to take picture of a person who issued a book and send it to a registered user.
